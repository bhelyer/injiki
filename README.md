# Injiki
An unfinished editor written in an unfinished language.

You probably don't want this. [There](http://www.vim.org/) [are](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [better](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [editors](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

## Notes
There's no automated installation at the moment.
Copy or symlink the executable (`injiki`) into your path.
For the desktop file to find the icon, copy `icon.png` as either `/usr/share/icons/injiki.png` or `/usr/local/share/icons/injiki.png` (if the latter path doesn't exist, you can create it).
